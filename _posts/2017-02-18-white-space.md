There is one thing I can not point out enough: making things obvious for the User. Often the easiest solution is the best one to go with. There is no need for fancy Split-Action-Buttons to hide certain actions when it’s not obvious for the user. Don’t get me wrong: it’s important to have e.g. animations guiding the user and explaining certain progresses. The UI is the first thing most people will recognize and studies have shown that a nice UI conveys sophistication and good performance. And it’s fun to work on.

Some times it is better to just write “Start Workout” instead of some 1px outline pictogram without any explanation that keeps the user questioning. This can lead to (too much) friction and/or frustration.

“In user experience, friction is defined as interactions that inhibit people from intuitively and painlessly achieving their goals within a digital interface.” –Victoria Young

A little bit of friction gives the user power. It’s like building something with your hands (IKEA Effect) or creating fire. But it is pretty hard to strike a balance here. It feels satisfying if you achieve something by your own right? A little help, but not too much.

The best solution here is to have bold and clear Iconography in addition to text or vise versa (color-coding also improves a lot). Make things clear. Good UI is important, but useless if the UX and the Copy fails. In the best case you are working with a copywriter. But most often the designer ends up with doing the copy. (Here are some good tips for improving your copy as a designer)

But back to topic: A good typeface, an easy to understand Iconography, color-coding and obvious (short) copy will be magic if done right.
